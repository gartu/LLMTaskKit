**COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT  
for the LLMTaskKit Project**

---

**Preamble**  
This Commercial License Agreement (the “Agreement”) applies to the use of the Python LLMTaskKit project (the “LLMTaskKit”). LLMTaskKit is available under a dual licensing model:  
- Under the GPL v3.0 license, available free of charge and subject to its open-source obligations, and  
- Under this Commercial License, which is intended for users who prefer a contractual commercial framework that avoids the obligations imposed by the GPL.

This Commercial License provides an alternative for those wishing to use LLMTaskKit without the open-source distribution requirements of the GPL v3.0.
